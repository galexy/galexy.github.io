** This is a test
Here is a test of the system.

| Foo       | Bar | Foo |
|-----------+-----+-----|
| Something | For | Us  |

#+BEGIN_SRC sql :exports none
-- this is a comment
SELECT * 
FROM transactions t
WHERE t.transaction_id > 1
#+END_SRC

** Here is another section

$$
\begin{align}
x&=\sqrt{b} \\
 &=\sqrt{a}\tag{1}
\end{align}
$$

That was a section that uses math expressions. What would be nice is if we could reference
an equation in our code without having to worry about updating the references. I wonder if 
that is possible.

Sometimes it's interesting to see if the system behaves the way you would expect.

*** Just another thought

Here is some R code.

#+begin_src R :exports both :results graphics :file ../images/regression_line.png
N <- 100
x <- 1:100
y <- x + rnorm(N)

plot(y ~ x)
abline(lm(y ~ x))
#+end_src

[[../images/regression_line.png]]

when $x < y$ then we have an issue

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
case class Foo(i: Integer, s: String)

val foo = Foo(1, "Test")
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
import re
for test_string in ['555-1212', 'ILL-EGAL']:
    if re.match(r'^\d{3}-\d{4}$', test_string):
        print test_string, 'is a valid US local phone number'
    else:
        print test_string, 'rejected'

1
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 555-1212 is a valid US local phone number
: ILL-EGAL rejected

#+begin_src octave
v = a * b'
if (v > 1) a else b
#+end_src
