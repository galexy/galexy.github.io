Things do not happen.
Things are made to happen.

This blog is a forcing function for me to write about what I've learned. I read a great deal and spend just as much time 
trying to internalize the material that I've absorbed. I find that for many subjects, I need learn from multiple sources,
each of which sheds light on the topic in a different way. Often, I need to paraphrase the ideas in order to fully
obtain apprehension of the subject.

But, I have not always been very good at synthesizing my thoughts into a permanent record. The result, is that for some
of the more advanced topics, I need to constantly refresh my (faded) memory. This blog is a forcing function for me to 
document my view of the subjects I find most important or useful.

I hope you enjoy my collection of topics. Hopefully, my writing helps elucidate the subject for you too.
