# Effective Haskell

I just recently finished reading Effective Haskell after waiting for the past
six months since I first hard about the book and pre-ordered it. The Haskell
community doesn't have many sources that compile important concepts and
techinques required to use Haskell proficentlly and potentially for production.
I've been excited by all the recent books attempting to teach aspiring
Haskellers something beyond the basics. Much of Haskell knowledge is spread
out in blog posts and hard to approach academic papers. There is virtually no
material that _teaches_ beginning Haskllers in how to think like a Haskell
programmer.
